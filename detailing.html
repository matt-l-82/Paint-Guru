							<p>This procedure removes organic and inorganic fallout from your vehicle’s
							surfaces. The way to tell if your paint work is contaminated is by running your hand over the surface, if it is not as smooth as glass and is rough then there are contaminants embedded on the surface. The vehicle will go through a thorough wash process to ensure that no further damage is inflicted onto the surfaces of the vehicle.</p><br>

							<p>- Vehicle is rinsed in a comprehensive multi-stage process<br>
							- Vehicle is washed with a deep pile wash mitt and 2 bucket method  <br>

						<h2 class="v1">Stage Two Detail – Prices from £350</h2>
						<p>When you have severe defects in your paint caused by very poor washing by the self-service automated car washes, water etching, birdlime etching, minor scuffs from car parks. These marks can reduce the depth of colour and rob the reflection and gloss in the paint. Darker paint will emphasis these defects more that lighter colour vehicles, even though the defects are there in the paint. Dependant upon the health of your paint your vehicle will go through a 2 stage paint correction that will start off with a cutting compound to remove the defects within the paint and followed by a lighter polishing stage to increase the gloss and clarity levels within the paint. These stages are carried out with care and
						precision to ensure that the minimum amount of clear coat is removed to
 						improve the clarity. Machining takes an average of 25-35 hours alone to achieve a finish that leaves a 80% defect free finish.</p><br>

To ensure that this finish is protected the paintwork is treated to multiple layers of high carnauba content wax or sealant.</p>
